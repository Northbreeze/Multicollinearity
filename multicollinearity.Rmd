## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(datasets)
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(viridis)
library(GGally)
library(car)
library(gridExtra)
library(knitr)
```

```{r}
df <- longley
str(df)
```




```{r}

#now fitting a linear model
model <- lm(Employed ~ GNP + Unemployed + Armed.Forces + Population + Year, data = df)
vif(model)
```

```{r}

```
```{r}
#now fitting a linear model again
model2 <- lm(Employed ~ Unemployed + Armed.Forces + Year, data = df)

vif(model2)
```
